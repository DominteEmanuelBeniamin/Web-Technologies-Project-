    <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
    
    <h2>1.1 Objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web-based platform that facilitates feedback across diverse domains, including events, individuals, locations, products, services, and artworks. Feedback submissions will be anonymized and categorized based on various emotions using the Plutchik model, which offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and organizing human emotions.</p>
    <p>Utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and other pertinent technologies, we aim to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface for users to engage with the platform seamlessly. The integration of these technologies will ensure efficient data presentation and management, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
    <p>Powered by a REST/GraphQL API, the platform will manage the collection and organization of feedback from users. Post-collection, comprehensive reports will be generated, leveraging insights derived from the Plutchik model. These reports will provide statistical analyses, considering factors such as user demographics, timing of feedback submission, and sentiment analysis based on expressed emotions.</p>
    <p>The generated reports will be available in multiple formats, including HTML, CSV, and JSON, catering to diverse user preferences. Additionally, efforts will be made to present the data in visually engaging formats, optimizing user comprehension and engagement.</p>
    <p>By incorporating the principles of the Plutchik model and utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and related technologies, this project aims to deliver a robust feedback platform that not only facilitates meaningful interactions but also ensures accessibility and usability for all users.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Product Scope</h2>
    <p>Our product encompasses a comprehensive suite of features and functionalities tailored to facilitate seamless feedback management and analysis. Key components of our product include:</p>
