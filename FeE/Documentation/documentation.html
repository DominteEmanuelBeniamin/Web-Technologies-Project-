    <h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<h2>1.1 Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a web-based tool that enables users to provide feedback for various entities (such as events, people, geographic locations, products, services, artistic artifacts, etc.) in an anonymous manner. Feedback, in this context, is understood as expressing a specific emotion according to the Plutchik model. The application, through a REST/GraphQL API, should manage the entities to be evaluated and the specific responses for each (editable by the initiator of a feedback collection request). After the completion of the period during which a form is accessible to individuals for reviewing a particular entity, statistics of interest regarding each category of evaluated entities according to each recorded emotion will be presented. Multiple criteria will be considered, such as user group, evaluation time period, subcategories of entities, positive/negative characteristics based on the shared emotion, etc. The generated reports will be available in HTML, CSV, and JSON formats. Additionally, implementing attractive data visualization methods as described in the provided bonus resource will be pursued.</p>

<h2>1.2 Product Scope</h2>
<p>The product scope includes the following features and functionalities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Users can submit feedback for various entities anonymously. They will have the option to specify their emotions according to the Plutchik model.</li>
    <li><strong>Entity Management:</strong> The application should allow administrators to manage the entities that are open for feedback. This includes adding, editing, and removing entities from the system.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Response Management:</strong> Initiators of feedback collection requests should have the ability to manage the responses received for each entity. They can view, edit, and analyze the feedback data.</li>
    <li><strong>Statistics Generation:</strong> After the feedback collection period for an entity concludes, the system will generate statistics regarding the emotions expressed for that entity. These statistics will be categorized based on various criteria such as user demographics, time periods, and subcategories of entities.</li>
    <li><strong>Report Generation:</strong> Reports summarizing the feedback statistics will be generated in HTML, CSV.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
<p>The product perspective provides a comprehensive view of how the feedback application integrates within the broader landscape of systems and services. It elucidates the interconnectedness and interdependencies between the feedback application and other components within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Specifically, it outlines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The primary goals and objectives of the feedback application in relation to the overall system or service.</li>
    <li>The role and function of the feedback application within the larger context, including its interactions with other software components or platforms.</li>
    <li>Any external interfaces or dependencies that the feedback application relies on for seamless operation.</li>
    <li>Potential impacts on existing systems or services due to the introduction or integration of the feedback application.</li>
</ul>
